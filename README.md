# Earthworks Inspections - Geospatial View

A Web Frontend for Engineers and Inspectors to visualize and aggregate data regarding requested and critical earthworks inspections.

This demo consists of a Flask App with Sqlite3 as backend server and a Single Page Application (SPA) in Vanilla JS as frontend. Both communicate via a [REST API](./docs/api.md).
